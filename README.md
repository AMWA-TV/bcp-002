### What do the recommendations do?

- Document best practice and recommendations for how to indicate and handle Groups of Resources in AMWA NMOS APIs.

### Why do they matter?

- Provide a consistent way of referring to groups of related Resources (e.g. video and audio Senders of a camera)
- This helps with interoperability and integration.

### What are the recommendations?

- [BCP-002-01](https://specs.amwa.tv/bcp-002-01) addresses "Natural Groups", i.e. those created by the default operation of a Node/Device, and not     user- or automation-defined Groups.
