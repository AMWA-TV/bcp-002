### What do the recommendations do?

- Document best practice and recommendations for how to use `label`, `description` and `tags` in AMWA NMOS APIs.

### Why do they matter?

- Provide a consistent way of referring to groups of related Resources (e.g. video and audio Senders of a camera)
- Provide a consistent way of distinguishing between Resources
- Provide a consistent way of annotating Resources with user information.

### What are the recommendations?

- See the [list of BCPs](https://specs.amwa.tv/nmos/#nmos-best-common-practices-bcp) on the main NMOS page.
